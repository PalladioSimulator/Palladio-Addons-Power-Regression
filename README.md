We use the profiles extracted using our profiler as input to statistical learning techniques such as robust nonlinear regression or symbolic regression (genetic programming). Our toolchain enables an easy integration of further parametrization techniques. The framework we built for training power models integrates with our Eclipse-based power modeling tools.
